# clockoutV2
This repo contains all the new files for the 2021 clockout refresh. I hope to fulfill the following goals in this project:
- [ ] migrate to PHP to allow for the creation of user accounts and the storage of user data
- [ ] adopt bootstrap 4.6 as the foundation for page styling
- [ ] remove any jQuery (this one is hard as I've become dependent on jQuery)
- [ ] refactor the core algorithm for building the financial forecast
- [ ] include new investment types
- [ ] include expenses (such as college funds, end of life estates, etc)
- [ ] include more basic tools for helping and attracting users
- [ ] redesign the UI
- [ ] capture monetary fallout for affected personas
- [ ] improve reporting
- [ ] include charts using charts.js or a similar library
- [ ] improve my UI design skills (primarily focused on color and appearance)

And a stretch goal for this update:
- [ ] improve tax estimates
